Lilac Girls: A Novel (Woolsey-Ferriday) by Martha Hall Kelly Book Review

Name: BooksAndStuff
Rating: 3.0 out of 5 stars
Title: Two uninteresting, unlikable characters overshadow the interesting Kasia, one of The Rabbits
Date: Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2016
Review: As a lover of historical fiction, I was disappointed in Lilac Girls. Though the book has been researched, according to the author's note at the end of the novel, the poor writing made the novel seemed like a summary in many places instead of like a story. The book is dreadfully written, and not just because the author used to be an advertiser (or something like that) because there are many well written advertisements. She just doesn't write with any kind of style, the descriptions were shoved in during important action, and the name brand and name dropping got ridiculous pretty early on.

I didn't understand the title, unless it's the corny mention of lilacs blooming again after a hard winter that one of the narrators, Caroline, says to the survivor Kasia. If so, it was insulting. The cover was also misleading and offensive. The three women in the story are not friendly, and could never be: in fact, one of the characters tortures and maims another, and the third meets the victim, but not the villian(ess). I know the author doesn't pick book covers, but it was still offensive and misleading, so editor, take note.

The book itself begins by alternating chapters like this: Caroline, Kasia, Herta. Then it becomes Caroline, Kasia, Caroline, Kasia, Herta. Then, finally, it's something like this: Caroline, Caroline, Caroline, Kasia, Kasia, Kasia, Kasia, Kasia, Caroline, Caroline, Herta. Very weird alternating the chapters but devoting more and more of the book to only a few of the original narrators.

The novel follows the WWII stories (and briefly after) of three women: NY socialite and philanthropist Caroline Ferriday, Polish Underground member Kasia, and Nazi doctor Herta Oberheuser. The first and the last characters are based on real persons, and they are the most boring characters in the novel.

Caroline is pretentious and self-absorbed, flitting about the French Embassy until the War closes it, constantly reminding us that she doesn't have to work for a living and doesn't get a salary but that doesn't matter because she doesn't have to ever really work for a living like most of the characters in the book (or like the people who are reading the book). Caroline is the single most uninteresting person in the book. And she gets worse as the novel goes on, until she is finally doing nothing but naming all the celebrities at a party, and describing her dress only by the name of the designer, who I never heard of. Even though Caroline helps the women who suffered the Nazi medical experiments, called "The Rabbits," I simply could not care for her. And the love story was totally superfluous and dull. The author says she made up the Paul character to give Caroline "more of a connection to France," but since the real Caroline had an apartment in France and spent part of the year there every year while she was growing up, I didn't understand why the author felt the book Caroline needed a man to feel connected to France once the war started. In any case, their romance was colder than snow in the Arctic, and I felt nothing for them when they were separated.

The Nazi doctor, Herta Oberheuser, is basically as undeveloped as Caroline. She starts off being extremely anti-Semitic and very pro-Nazi, then suddenly arrives at the sole concentration camp exclusively for women, Ravensbr√ºck, reluctant to do anything bad to the inmates, even though they are all technically enemies of the Reich. Her change in attitude toward the Jews and other prisoners is never explained. the novel does not explore the Jews who were in the Camps. I realize that the Camp may not have had that many Jewish inmates, but I thought the Nazis considered anyone who was in the Camps as inferior or as abnormal or as criminals. That's why Herta's reluctance to "do her job" didn't ring true. Her friend Fritz starts off being really enthusiastic about killing the inmates and telling Herta that she better get with the program, but by the time the Camp is about to be liberated, Fritz is horrified by what the Nazis, meaning Fritz and Herta, are doing to the inmates, and Herta acts like she can't figure out what's wrong with him. Again, no indication about why these characters changed their minds or attitudes. Also, since Herta does not have as large a share of the book as the other two narrators, she basically appears less and less as the book progresses, so her feelings and motivations were very undeveloped in her story. During her trial, which the author claims was based on the real Dr trials at Nuremberg, the "excerpts" from the trial would last about 5 minutes in a courtroom, so I wondered what on earth the author left out and why. Herta was a very weak part of the novel, and I actually do not understand why the author made her one of the narrators if she wasn't going to truly explore the character's motivations.

The most interesting character was Kasia, the Ravensbr√ºck inmate, who was a composite of many of the women who were operated on in the Camp. Some reviewers have complained that they didn't like the book because Kasia wasn't a real person, but I thought she was more interesting (and I cared about her more) than any of the other characters, including Caroline and Herta. Of course, I realize that no one was supposed to care about Herta since the author didn't write the book in a way that readers could understand her, but I got the feeling, given all Caroline's chapters, that the author wanted readers to care about Caroline, and that just didn't happen. Kasia was a fascinating character. I was so interested in what happened to her that I started to read her chapters, just to satisfy myself that she survived and to find out what happened to her, then went back and read the chapters of Caroline and Herta. Kasia's story fell apart in the final sections of the book when she gets married, has a child, then comes to America to get medical treatment because the author starts summarizing the story events instead of showing them to us so we can get emotionally involved. But for most of the book, Kasia is fantasic.

I definitely agree with other reviewers who complain about the book's writing. It is terrible. And their reviews are detailed enough that you can get all the information about the writing from them, so I'm not going to repeat what they already said. I also have a bit of a problem with the way the author ignored the fact that the Holocaust happened primarily to the Jews, and didn't mention the fact that the Nazis practiced genocide against the Jewish population of Europe. She just shoved a couple paragraphs in when some part-Jewish neighbor of Kasia's was shipped from Auschwitz to Ravensbr√ºck and died right after telling Kasia what happened to them, and that was all she wrote about the Jews and the Holocaust. If the author wanted to only write about Ravensbr√ºck and its women inmates who were tortured in medical experiments, then she should have only written about The Rabbits. By mentioning the Jews and what happened to them at Auschwitz, she made their story unimportant. She should have left it out. By putting it in as a little paragraph or two, she made it seem like the Holocaust wasn't about the Jews at all. That bothered me. I would have liked it better if she had never mentioned them at all and just made the book about The (non-Jewish) Rabbits.

I'd never heard about The Rabbits or about the experiments done in Ravensbr√ºck, so that's why I gave the book 3 stars instead of 2. Though it was sad to read about what happened to those women and girls, I wanted to know what it was about. That part of the story kept me reading and made me finish the book. If it had only had Caroline, I never would have read it all. If it had only Caroline and Herta, I would not have finished it. I guess the made-up character Kasia is the one whose story got me to finish the book despite its really bad writing and character development.

Title: Part 3 is the best part of the book
Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2020
Review: You know those books that everyone seems to rave about and when you finally read them, just don‚Äôt seem to hold up to what everyone was talking about? That‚Äôs what this book was for me. So why the four-star rating? Because part three brought everything together quite beautifully and I finally, *finally,* loved it.

The book‚Äôs narrative is divided between three characters and into three parts. The first character, Caroline Ferriday, was a New York City socialite and former broadway star. She is also a real person from history who worked tirelessly as a humanitarian for French orphans and the ‚ÄúRavensbruck Rabbits.‚Äù Her story was interesting but was honestly the most confusing to me throughout the first two parts of the book. I could not figure out how this woman, so far removed from everything happening in Europe, had anything to do with the other stories of the book. Also, how she handled Paul‚Äôs wife was a bit disappointing considering what his wife had gone through, but that could be a harsh judgement on my part.

The second character is a Polish teenager, Kasia Kuzmerick, who was arrested and sent to Ravensbruck. She became one of the prisoners who suffered through experimental surgeries on her leg at the hands of German doctors. These women who went through these degrading and gruesome surgeries became known as the ‚ÄúRabbits,‚Äù partially because they were forced to hop around camp to be able to get around, and also because they were the German‚Äôs ‚Äúexperimental rabbits.‚Äù She and her sister were based on two sisters who were prisoners at Ravensbruck. Her character was by far the most heart rending. She went through so much and to watch her go from being a carefree, sometimes thoughtless young teen, to the survivor in camp, to the bitter woman she became, and then to watch her transform and begin to heal was really quite remarkable. Her‚Äôs was my favorite of the stories, though hers is also the most difficult to read.

Herta Oberheuser was the third character and a German doctor. The only woman doctor who worked at Ravensbruck, as it would turn out. This account was the fictional telling of the true Herta who worked in Ravensbruck and helped perform countless surgeries on the women prisoners there, all in the name of the Reich and the ‚Äúgreater good‚Äù of Germany. While Kasia‚Äôs story was difficult to read because of the atrocities and PTSD she had to live and suffer through, Herta‚Äôs was difficult because of the inhumanity. There was so much justification, so much personal brainwashing. And what happened to her after her war crimes trial really made me angry! It was definitely disturbing to read how someone could feel justified and right in doing such cruel things to other human beings.

Parts 1 and 2 of the book are good, but again, I was confused how any of the three women would come together. Herta and Kasia do, obviously, because they were both at Ravensbruck. But Caroline was an utter mystery. It all becomes clear in Part 3 and the back stories of all three from the previous two sections do help play a crucial role in making Part 3 a success. I think Part 3 is the shining glory of the whole book and would have loved more of what was there. Overall, it‚Äôs a good book, just know going in that the disjointed stories of the three women will not make sense until you‚Äôre closer to the end than the beginning or even the middle. Parts 1 & 2 get three stars from me but Part 3 is worth five.

Note: contains disturbing content‚Äîremember, one of the primary characters was a prisoner/patient at Ravensbr√ºck, where female prisoners were subjected to terrible experimental surgeries. Though the details are not overly graphic, there are still some details of those surgeries and the future effects of them upon the women there. Another main character was one of the doctors at Ravensbr√ºck, and she has a very apathetic attitude about her part in the atrocities committed there. Also in the book: other treatments and murders of German prisoners in their concentration camps. What happened to orphaned/abandoned children, including children with German fathers and French mothers (so sad!). There is also talk of sex/sexual relations, and one steamy kissing scene that doesn‚Äôt progress to anything more (though it is on it‚Äôs way to more before getting interrupted).

AUDIOBOOK REVIEW: Read by: Cassandra Campbell, Kathleen Gati, and Kathrin Kana. Each of these women did a marvelous job with their readings. I really loved that there was a different voice for each character. I think it brought the story more alive. The accents were very well done and the reading was excellent.
